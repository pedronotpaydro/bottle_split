  description: "Originally brewed in honor of the 1000th batch at our original Clybourn brewpub. A liquid as dark and dense as a black hole with thick foam the color of a bourbon barrel. The nose is an intense mix of charred oak, chocolate, vanilla, caramel and smoke. One sip has more flavor than your average case of beer",

  All told, this beer lands at 14%, but the experience drinking it tucks all of the ethanol away in place of a luscious, two-ton mellow.

  Vanilla, BBL driven coconut, bourbon, cinnamon, cherry, chocolate and density all equally synthesized. A really deep beer that lands full panorama",
